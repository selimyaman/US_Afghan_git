The research looks at the Twitter users' variation in ideology and sentiments towards the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.

## Methodology

We utilized several methods when doing Tweet analyses. These are:

1. Tweet Pull using API V.2
2. Location Extraction
3. Data Cleaning (Basics)
4. Data Cleaning (Bot removals)
5. Ideology Estimation
6. Sentiment Analysis (VADER)
7. Topic Modeling by Ideology (STM)

To replicate the materials, we also provide Tweet IDs. Twitter does not allow raw datasets to be shared publicly. You can use Tweet hydrators to build the dataset again. Replication results will be probably very close to our results, but not the same as some accounts will be deleted/protected after we compiled the dataset.

## Notes

This repo is currently un-organized. Upon acceptance, the documents will be re-organized for a smooth replication.
