# Tweet Pull

We curated two datasets, using same keywords as search parameters.

- **full sample** refers to the all the tweets that we pulled from Twitter, around ~16 million.
- **rep sample** refers to a representative sample of ~59k tweets, 1500 tweets from each week. We did our initial analysis using this dataset. Then, when everything settled down, we used the full sample.
